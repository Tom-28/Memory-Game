## The Game Explaination

The Memory Game is a classic game, whereas the User clicks on a field of hidden cards. 
By clicking the card moves around. The user progresses within the game when two cards show the same symbols and therefore matches.
The user wins the game, when all pairs of cards where found.

## Instructions

* Click on a card
* Keep revealing cards and try to remember the cards symbols
* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time

## Dependencies

The basic layer of the memory game, the structure and content, is done by the html. Within the html file the styles and interactivity (layers) of the game are implemented. Therefore the external styles.css and functionality.js files are integrated within the index.html. The geometry2.png is included as well as background picture
